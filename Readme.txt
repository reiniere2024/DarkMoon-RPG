Hi All,

Darkmoon RPG is a RPG Game that I made to try to restore the RPG gaming fun
of older games like Eye of the Beholder and Lands of Lore.
I have generated a RPG 3D Game Engine (last pictures) to be able to generate
the 3D maps, the monsters and all other RPG items for a good working game.

This first module is the introduction and is meant for gamers to familiarize
themselves with the game and its mechanics. 

I have planned and am currently developing 5 other longer modules that will be
introduced later on this year. These module will contain maps and scenes from 
the catacombs, the silver towers, the azure towers and the crimson towers.

Good luck,
Reiniere.
